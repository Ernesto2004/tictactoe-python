# Tic Tac Toe
_Simple Tic Tac Toe made on Python for fun. The way this works is you get a drawn tic tac toe board in the command prompt with 9 cells. To place a mark on the board, you  give the program the number of the cell where you want to place it. An example of an appropriate cell number is **A2**._
